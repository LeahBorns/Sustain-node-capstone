# Sustain-node-capstone
Sustain is both a game and an educational tool for music fans to encourage the application of sustainable practices into an everyday routine. By signing up for practices users are committing to these practices and can gain points for each practice done daily. In addition to daily commitment, a short description of their experience and/or photo/video proof will gain users additional points. Sustain is also a way for fans to engage with their favorite artist. By gaining points, those points will go to the fans to get free swag as well as to the artist to decrease their carbon footprint through the help of their fans.
